    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>
        By downloading or using our apps, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the apps. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the apps, any part of
        the apps, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the apps,
        and you also shouldn’t try to translate the apps into other languages or make derivative versions.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are committed to ensuring that our apps are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
        the right to make changes to the apps or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
        never charge you for the apps or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying
        for.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our apps use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. Please refer to their policies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube API Services</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Internet Connection</h2>
    <p>
        Certain functions of the apps will require the apps to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
        Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the apps not working at
        full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you’re using our apps outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with
        your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
        cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the apps, or other third-party charges. In using
        the apps, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the
        apps outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not
        the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the apps, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the apps.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibility for Video Content</h2>
    <p>
        Our apps provide access to videos through YouTube’s API and player, along with tools to enhance the learning
        experience, such as dual subtitles. Please note that YouTube hosts a wide variety of content, some of which may
        not be suitable for all audiences. We do not control the content available on YouTube and cannot take
        responsibility for any inappropriate or offensive material you may encounter. Users are solely responsible for
        their choice of videos.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates and Changes</h2>
    <p>
        With respect to our responsibility for your use of our apps, when you’re using the apps, it’s important to bear
        in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third
        parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. We accept no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the apps.
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the apps. Our apps are currently available on Android & iOS – the
        requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the apps
        to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the apps. We do not promise
        that it will always update our apps so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version
        that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the applications when
        offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the apps and may terminate use of it at any time without
        giving notice of termination to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>

        for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
