    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>
        These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the <strong>"DuoLang: Watch & Learn"</strong> app. By downloading
        or using the app,
        you agree to these terms. Please ensure you read them carefully before using the app.
    </p>

    <p>
        You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not
        allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
        other languages or make derivative versions.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
        the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never
        charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app uses third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. Please refer to their policies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube API Services</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
                Privacy Policy</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Internet Connection</h2>
    <p>
        Certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
        provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with
        your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
        cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app or other third-party charges. In using
        the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
        outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming.
    </p>

    <h2>App Updates and Termination</h2>
    <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS – the
        requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
        to) may change, and you’ll need to download updates if you want to keep using the app. We do not promise to
        always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android or iOS version that you have
        installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate its use at any time without giving you notice. Upon
        termination, the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end, and you must stop using the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
        for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms and Conditions, feel free to contact us.
